# Terrain
Creating a 3d terrain in WebGL, with each step being made as a Github release.

- Step 1: [Setup three.js](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.1)
- Step 2: [Create terrain](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.2)
- Step 3: [Load heightmap](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.3)
- Step 4: [Texture terrain](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.4)
- Step 5: [Add "collision"](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.5)
- Step 6: [First person controls](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.6)
- Step 7: [Add fog](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.7)
- Step 8: [Add jumping & running](https://github.com/wybiral/terrain/releases/tag/0.8)

**A live demo of the most recent step is available [here](https://wybiral.github.io/terrain/).**

# Particle Systems
**Credits:** The code for the particle systems is heavily inspired by a tutorial found here: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/h1UQdbuF204)

Each effect has it own particle system file, all varying slightly in the makeup of parameters and setting of behavioral values.

This project includes fire effects, rain effects, cloud effects, snow effects, and petal effects, however petals are not implemented in the terrain as we didn't have time to figure out how to add them to each tree.

To showcase our particle effects and systems, we generated numerous cloud effects, rain effects, and snow effects around the starting point of the user. These effects' parameters can then be modified by the UI present. Each tab affects the effect named. Pressing the preset button resets all values to original values.

Collision and piling of particles was not able to be implemented.

If there are any issues or causes for loss of grade due to the particle systems, please only mark down Simon Yoo.
